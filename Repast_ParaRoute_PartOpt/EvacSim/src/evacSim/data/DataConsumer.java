/**
 * evacSim.data.DataConsumer
 * 
 * Classes wishing to read data form the EvacSim data collection buffer
 * should implement the methods of this interface and be registered with
 * the DataCollector instance within the program.
 * 
 * Data consumers are required to respond to simple control signals (start,
 * stop, reset, etc.) as well as provide the current tick number of the
 * simulation they are processing from the buffer.  The data collection 
 * buffer will attempt to manage the buffer and purge any unnecessary data.  
 * Once all registered consumers have signaled they are past a particular
 * tick in the buffer (which is stored sequentially), the data collector
 * is free to discard that data item to free memory within the simulation.
