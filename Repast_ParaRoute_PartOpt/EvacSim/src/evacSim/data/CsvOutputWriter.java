/**
 * evacSim.data.CsvOutputWriter
 * 
 * This data consumer writes the contents of the simulation output buffer
 * to disk in the CSV format.  If no file is specified, the output will
 * be written to the same location as this program with a default name
 * of the format "EvacSim_Output_<timestamp>.csv".  If this is the case,
 * a new filename with an updated timestamp will be used for each restart 
 * of the writing process.
 * 
 * The first field of each line is the simulation tick to which the data
 * of the line pertains, and the second field of each line is the type of
 * data represented by that line.  Each additional field from the third
 * column to the end of the line is specific to the type of data being
 * represented by that line.
