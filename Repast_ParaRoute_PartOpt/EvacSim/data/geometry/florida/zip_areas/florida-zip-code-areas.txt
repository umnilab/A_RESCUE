Description:
  ZIP Code Areas (Five-Digit) represents five-digit ZIP Code areas used by the
  U.S. Postal Service to deliver mail more effectively. The first digit of a
  five-digit ZIP Code divides the United States into 10 large groups of states
  numbered from 0 in the Northeast to 9 in the far West. Within these areas, each
  state is divided into an average of 10 smaller geographical areas, identified by
  the second and third digits. These digits, in conjunction with the first digit,
  represent a sectional center facility or a mail processing facility area. The
  fourth and fifth digits identify a post office, station, branch or local
  delivery area.
